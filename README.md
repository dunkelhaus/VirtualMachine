# VirtualMachine

A Multi-Threaded Virtual Machine designed using C++, built upon a Machine Abstraction layer (Abstraction not authored by me; See sources). Current capabilities include multithreading and mutual exclusion. Primary file (virtualization of machine) is VirtualMachine.cpp. However, needs the abstraction layer and other files provided to run. 

"apps" folder contains test cases.
